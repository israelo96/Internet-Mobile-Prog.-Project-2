# Internet Mobile Programing - Project-2

In this project was developed a game called “The Flying Fish”. In this app, the user must click on the touch screen to make the fish go up to catch some balls of three 
different colours: yellow, green and red. The last ones remove one life (out of three) to the fish, and the other will add points to the score.
The game mimics some features of the famous Flappy Bird game. The touched hardware was: LEDs to represent fish’s lives; 
colour LEDs to represent the colour of the balls caught by the fish;  piezo buzzer to sound with different musical key depending on the ball caught by the user 
and also keypad to restart the game.
